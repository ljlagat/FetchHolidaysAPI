Experiements done using Calendarific Global Holidays API. This is an API that fetches holidays in over 230 countries across the world.
This API supports CORS and uses API Key.
Before development, I tested API on postman where I picked the headers and params  and confirmed that it works.
I have experiemnted with Asynch and Await functions as well as Promises.
Code works as, (index.js / index.html) and (index2.js / index2.html) respectively.
Several calls made to API and was able to fetch over 100 holidays
